This is a implementation of the algorithm in [Fast Solution for the Diagonal Elements of the Inverse of a Tridiagonal Matrix *](http://www.lanl.gov/DLDSTP/fast/diagonal.pdf). I wrote the implementation to speed up the code used in [Localization of Ultrasound in a Three-Dimensional Elastic Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.1502.pdf)  while adapting it for the scattering of light.
